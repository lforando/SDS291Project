##Abstract:




##Introduction:

The purpose of our project is to estimate a male individual's neck circumference based on their age, weight, wrist size, bicep size, and height. Knowing your neck circumference is a common measurement that men often need to know in order to buy clothing such as a button down shirt or neck ties. It has also been found that there is a connection between neck size, sleep apnea, and snoring. The larger one's neck is, the more likely they will have health complications (such as breathing when sleeping). Therefore, knowing one's neck size is not only important for fashion reasons but also health reasons.

##Data:

The original data set includes estimates of the percentage of body fat determined by underwater weighing and various body circumference measurements for 252 men between the ages of 22 and 81. While the initial purpose of the data set was to determine body fat percentage of men based on a multitude of predictor variables, in our case we are interested in exploring whether or not there is a linear relationship between an individuals’ neck circumference and age, weight, wrist circumference, bicep circumference and height; and if we can appropriately estimate an individuals’ neck circumference knowing their age, weight, wrist circumference, bicep circumference and height. 

The original data set can be found here: <http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/bodyfat>.

Our population is 252 men between the ages of 22 and 81. The following variables were collected for each of the men: Density determined from underwater weighing, Percent body fat from Siri's (1956) equation, Age (years), Weight (lbs), Height (inches), Neck circumference (cm), Chest circumference (cm), Abdomen 2 circumference (cm), Hip circumference (cm), Thigh circumference (cm), Knee circumference (cm), Ankle circumference (cm), Biceps (extended) circumference (cm), Forearm circumference (cm), Wrist circumference (cm). Each column of the data set (from left to right) corresponds to each variable (first to last). With this data we will find the estimate of a male individual’s neck circumference based on their age, weight, wrist circumference, bicep circumference and height.

#Renaming variable columns for easier use

#We decided to rename our variable columns because the original variable names were too long and could easily be messed up. Using the dplyr package, we selected the variables we were interested in and put them into a new dataframe we titled "neck_size". Then, using the tidyverse package, we were able to use the rename function which allows us to rename any variable. We decided to rename the variables we were interested in with shorter names for easier coding purposes. 

neck_size <- bodyfat %>%
  select(`Age (years)`, `Weight (lbs)`, `Wrist circumference (cm)`, `Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)`, `Height (inches)`, `Neck circumference (cm)`) %>% rename(
  age = 'Age (years)',
  weight = 'Weight (lbs)',
  wrist = 'Wrist circumference (cm)',
  bicep = 'Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)',
  height = 'Height (inches)',
  neck = 'Neck circumference (cm)')
```



##Results:

```{r}
plot(neck ~ age, data = neck_size)
plot(neck ~ weight, data = neck_size)
plot(neck ~ wrist, data = neck_size)
plot(neck ~ bicep, data = neck_size)
plot(neck ~ height, data = neck_size)
```

If we look at the individual scatter plots for each of our predictor variables, we see that weight, wrist size, and bicep size all have fairly strong positive linear correlations with neck size. However, both age and height showed almost no correlation with neck size.

```{r}
#Multiple Regression Model With Our 5 Predictor Variables
neck_lm <- lm(neck ~ age + weight + wrist + bicep + height, data = neck_size)
summary(neck_lm)

#Multiple Regression Model w/o Height
no_height_lm <- lm(neck ~ age + weight + wrist + bicep, data = neck_size)
summary(no_height_lm)

#Multiple Regression Model w/o Height and Age
no_age_lm <- lm(neck ~ weight + wrist + bicep, data = neck_size)
summary(no_age_lm)
```
First, we wanted to analyze the relationship between anticipated neck size and age, weight, wrist circumference, bicept circumference, and height. Because we are looking at multiple predictor variables, we will be running a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model. 

After analyzing our first model, we wanted to know if we could find a simpler model that can tell us roughly the same about estimating neck size. This lead us to taking out height for Model 2. We then went even further and decided to take out age for Model 3. More is explained about this when analyzing the ANOVA tables. 

Including height only increases our $R^2$ value by 0.0001. By removing height, our adjusted $R^2$ increases from 0.7386 to 0.7396. So, the model without height is a better predictor of neck size than the model including height. Looking at the p-values for the coefficients in our first model, we see that the p-value for height is 0.7978 making this variable not statistically significant to our regression model. Therefore, we removed it in our second model. Then, turning to our coefficient p-values in our second regression model, we see that age has the highest p-value at 0.03058, although being low enough to be statistically significant, it was still very high compared to the other p-values. We removed this because looking back at the individual scatter plots we see that the scatter plot between neck circumference and age had no correlation.


```{r}

#ANOVA of our three possible models to determine which model is the best.

#ANOVA of Model 2 and Model 1
anova(no_height_lm, neck_lm)

#ANOVA of Model 3 and Model 1
anova(no_age_lm, neck_lm)

#ANOVA of Model 3 and Model 2
anova(no_age_lm, no_height_lm)
```

Analyzing our ANOVA tables, we can see that Model 3 has the smallest p-value for the nested F-test out of our three models. Model 3 has the lowest p-value in both of its ANOVA tables, making it the most statistically significant model. When Model 1 and Model 3 were compared, there was a p-value of 0.09383, indicating that Model 3 is statistically better than Model 1 at a 90% significance level. When Model 3 was compared to Model 2, it had a p-value of 0.03058, once again indicating that Model 3 is statistically better than Model 2 at a significance level of both 90% and 95%. The nested F-test comparing Model 1 and Model 2 had a p-value of 0.7978, showing that the difference between the two models is not statistically significant. 

The intercept of “neck” in the model no_age_lm, is understood as for someone who weighs zero pounds and has both a wrist and bicep circumference of zero centimeters, will have a neck circumference of 13.31 cm. The coefficient of "weight" in the model no_age_lm, is understood as for every increase of one pound in someone's weight, there is a 0.042 cm increase in the measurement of someone's neck, holding all other variables constant. The coefficient of "wrist" in the model no_age_lm, is understood as for every increase in the measurement of someone's wrist circumference by one centimeter, there is a 0.73 cm increase in the measurement of someone's neck, holding all other variables constant. The coefficient of "bicep" in the model no_age_lm, is understood as for every increase in the measurement of someone's bicep circumference by one centimeter, there is a 0.118 cm increase in the measurement of someone's neck, holding all other variables constant.


**Confidence Intervals**
```{r}
#Finding the 95% confidence Intervals for our third model 
confint(no_age_lm)
```

We are 95% confident that the true effect of weight on neck circumference, controlling for wrist and bicep circumference, is 0.03194604 and 0.05207665 cm. We are 95% confident that the true effect of wrist on neck circumference, controlling for weight and bicep circumference, is 0.48767606 and 0.97792142 cm. We are 95% confident that the true effect of bicep circumference on neck circumference, controlling for weight and wrist circumference, is 0.03165438 and 0.20443122 cm.

**VIF**
```{r}
#Variance Inflation Factor - used to check Collinearity
vif(no_age_lm)
```

Since all three coefficients analyzed are less than 5, there is no collinearity between these variables.


**Residual Plots**
```{r}
#Plot residuals
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(no_age_lm)
```

***

* The Residuals vs Fitted model shows that most of the data points fall equally above and below a horizontal line. This indicates that there is constant variance among our data points.

* The Normal Q-Q plot shows that the majority of our data points fall on a straight line. This indicates that our data points are normally distributed.

* The Residuals vs Leverage plot tells us that there are no outliers since none of the data points are past the designated area of Cook's distance.

**Identifying Unusual Points in Regression**
```{r}
#Outliers, Leverage, and Influence
##Outliers: Points that do not fit the regression line well, far away vertically from other points.
##Leverage: How far away a point is horizontally from the center of the data.
##Influence: How much a point draws the slope of the regression toward that point

#Identifying Unusual Points in Regression
neck_diag <- ls.diag(no_age_lm)

hi_funusual = 8/282
hi_vunusual = 10/282

Unusual_Neck <- neck_size %>%
mutate(h_i = neck_diag$hat,
       resid = no_age_lm$resid, 
       stnd_res = neck_diag$std.res, 
       stud_res = neck_diag$stud.res, 
       fitted = no_age_lm$fitted,
       cooks = neck_diag$cooks) %>%
  filter(stnd_res > 2|stnd_res < -2| stud_res > 2|stud_res < -2| cooks >= 0.5| h_i >= hi_funusual)

V_Unusual_Neck <- neck_size %>%

       resid = no_age_lm$resid, 
       stnd_res = neck_diag$std.res, 
       stud_res = neck_diag$stud.res, 
       fitted = no_age_lm$fitted,
       cooks = neck_diag$cooks) %>%
  filter(stnd_res > 3|stnd_res < -3| stud_res > 3|stud_res < -3| cooks >= 1| h_i >= hi_vunusual)

There are 26 possible men that can be classified as “unusual” according to the set above. The 26 men are given in the table below, including their age, weight, wrist size, bicep size, height, and neck circumference, as well as their "fairly usual" identification statistics. Out of those 26 men, 11 of them can be considered to be very "unusual".



##Conclusion:

In conclusion, the higher a man’s weight, bicep and wrist circumference are, the larger his predicted neck size will be. We are able to use the model’s fitted equation in order to predict a male's neck size. This is due to the model meeting linearity, homogeneity, non-collinearity and normality. Also, the model’s adjusted $R^2$ was high, the p-value for the coefficients in the linear regression model were all statistically significant and the nested F test’s p-value was also statistically significant. This implies that the model can be used for predicting a male's neck size. However, this model did not take into account ethnicity, age and previous weight gain.

In the future, we would like to be able to collect data that has classified the participants by race, the interactive term of significant weight loss and age. As this data was collected in the pool, gravity did not play a factor in regards to measurement. As muscle is lost as you get older, it would be interesting to see how this affect’s someone’s neck size. Another interesting effect on one's neck size could be the interactive term of someone losing a significant amount of weight and skin retention. Somoeone may have weighed more in the past and now just has excess skin.
